    tsc === typescript compiler

    TYPES
    ----
    1. Primitive types
        1.1. number - includes both number, float, double
        1.2. string
        1.3. boolean 

    note: 'type casing' 
            --> string, number ✅
            not --> interface String, interface Number ❌

    2. Type Assignment vs Type Inference
       
       Type Assignment 
       ----------------
        1. a.k.a Explicit typing
        2. Used when we are not aware about the values else 
           'tsc' will assign a type 'any' by default which is not recommended.
        eg:             
            let user; ❌
            let user: string = 'Suresh'; ❌
            const user: string = 'Suresh'; ❌
            let userName: string;  ✅

        Type Inference
        --------------
        1. a.k.a Implicit typing
        2. Used when we've known values or when we assign a value
        3. By default 'Types' will be infered by 'tsc'
        eg: 
            const user: string = 'Suresh'; ❌
            const user = 'Suresh';  ✅ - infered as string(on hover)
            let age = 10;
            age = 'Hey man' ❌  - will yell at us
